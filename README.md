Sunshine Adventure Camp is a facility that looks after 11 to 15 year olds during the winter and is only for the toughest kids. Groups go bush with a leader and fend for themselves. Each night the group leader radios in with their name, where they are, 
the number of campers and the current weather conditions. Each morning the camp leader radios in again to say if they are planning to stay or move on. Groups are always between 5 and 10 campers. 

This program allows the group leader to put in details about where they are, number of campers and the current weather conditions every morning and night. Then the user can store and display all past informations.
